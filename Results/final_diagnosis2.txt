### Final Diagnosis:

- **Panic disorder (primary anxiety‑driven)**
  * The episodes are sudden, 10–20 min in duration, and accompanied by chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, dizziness, and a pronounced sense of doom—classic panic‑attack features.  
  * Cardiac work‑up (echo, Holter, enzymes) has been normal, and the psychologist’s evaluation flags panic disorder as the most likely explanation for the somatic symptoms.  

- **Exercise‑induced arrhythmia / transient myocardial ischemia**
  * Holter monitoring shows occasional premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) and the cardiologist notes that brief, self‑terminating arrhythmic events can produce the reported palpitations and chest discomfort.  
  * The episodic nature of the symptoms (10–20 min during or after exertion) is consistent with either a latent arrhythmia or microvascular ischemia/vasospasm that would be uncovered by extended rhythm monitoring or exercise stress testing.  

- **Asthma / reactive airway disease (or vocal‑cord dysfunction)**
  * The pulmonologist recognizes symptoms of shortness of breath and chest tightness that could be due to reversible airway obstruction, even though the exam is currently clear.  
  * A bronchodilator‑responsive pattern on spirometry would explain the episodic SOB and chest tightness, while the absence of wheeze could also point toward vocal‑cord dysfunction, both of which can coexist with anxiety.
