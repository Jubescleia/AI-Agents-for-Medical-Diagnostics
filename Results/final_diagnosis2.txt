### Final Diagnosis:

- **Panic Disorder / Health‑Related Anxiety** – The psychologist's report lists classic panic‑attack features (shortness of breath, chest tightness, impending doom) and ongoing health anxiety; the cardiology work‑up found no structural or ischemic disease, supporting an anxiety‑driven origin.

- **Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC‑related Arrhythmia)** – Holter monitoring recorded occasional PVCs, which can trigger brief chest discomfort or light‑headedness; while not sustained, they remain a plausible organic explanation for the episodic symptoms.

- **Potential Coronary Vasospasm (Prinzmetal‑type Angina)** – Episodes of chest pain, diaphoresis, and dizziness at rest fit a vasospastic pattern; normal resting ECG/echo and lack of sustained arrhythmias do not rule out micro‑vasospasm, making it a reasonable differential.
