### Final Diagnosis:

- **Panic disorder with health‑anxiety** – the patient experiences recurrent, brief panic attacks (10–20 min) with sudden chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath and a feeling of impending doom, yet all cardiac tests (ECG, troponin, Holter, echo) are normal.  These findings, combined with a history of generalized anxiety and documented health‑anxiety, strongly point to a primary psychiatric trigger for the physical symptoms.

- **Mild intermittent asthma / exercise‑induced bronchospasm** – episodes of sudden shortness of breath and chest tightness that appear with exertion or stress, but with a normal resting chest exam and no wheeze.  Asthma can be completely asymptomatic at rest and is often precipitated by physical activity, anxiety, or GERD, matching the patient’s symptoms and the pulmonologist’s differential.

- **Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) / orthostatic tachycardia (POTS)** – the cardiology report lists PSVT, paroxysmal AF, and POTS as likely causes of the palpitations, dizziness, transient chest discomfort, and brief SOB, all of which are missed on a single‑day Holter.  Extended ambulatory monitoring is recommended because these arrhythmias are intermittent and can explain the episodic nature of the patient’s symptoms.
